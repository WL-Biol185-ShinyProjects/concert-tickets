## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##Generating Graph comparing cost of living and minimum ticket price (trendline)

Getting rid of NA rows

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(Final_Ticket_Data_COL, aes(Cost_of_Living_Index, Minimum_Ticket_Price)) + geom_point() +ylim(0,275)
       

```
